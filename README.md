# Kali Shell Scripts
These are shell scripts I've made to fix and configure things in Kali Linux that I've run into issues with in the past. This will include things that involve automating updates and fixes for problems I've dealt with while using Kali.

## Usage
Just navigate to the folder and copy + paste the code from the shell script (or clone the repo and do it like that, however you prefer), run chmod +x on it if needed, and modify the script as needed.
